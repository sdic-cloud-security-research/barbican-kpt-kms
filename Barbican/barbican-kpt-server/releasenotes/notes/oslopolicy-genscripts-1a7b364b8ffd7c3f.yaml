features:
  - Maintain the policy rules in code and add an oslo.policy CLI script
    in tox to generate policy sample file.

    The script can be called like
    "oslopolicy-sample-generator --config-file=etc/oslo-config-generator/policy.conf"
    and will generate a policy.yaml.sample file with the effective policy.
