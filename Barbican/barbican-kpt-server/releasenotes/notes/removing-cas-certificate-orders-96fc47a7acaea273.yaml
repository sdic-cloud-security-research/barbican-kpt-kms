  - Why are we deprecating Certificate Issuance?
    There are a few reasons that were considered for this decision.  First,
    there does not seem to be a lot of interest in the community to fully
    develop the Certificate Authority integration with Barbican.  We have a
    few outstanding blueprints that are needed to make Certificate Issuance
    fully functional, but so far no one has committed to getting the work
    done.  Additionally, we've had very little buy-in from public
    Certificate Authorities.  Both Symantec and Digicert were interested in
    integration in the past, but that interest didn't materialize into
    robust CA plugins like we hoped it would.

    Secondly, there have been new developments in the space of Certificate
    Authorities since we started Barbican.  The most significant of these
    was the launch of the Let's Encrypt public CA along with the definition
    of the ACME protocol for certificate issuance.  We believe that future
    certificate authority services would do good to implement the ACME
    standard, which is quite different than the API the Barbican team had
    developed.

    Lastly, deprecating Certificate Issuance within Barbican will simplify
    both the architecture and deployment of Barbican.  This will allow us to
    focus on the features that Barbican does well -- the secure storage of
    secret material.

  - Will Barbican still be able to store Certificates?

    Yes, absolutely!  The only thing we're deprecating is the plugin
    interface that talks to Certificate Authorities and associated APIs.
    While you will not be able to use Barbican to issue a new certificate,
    you will always be able to securely store any certificates in Barbican,
    including those issued by public CAs or internal CAs.
