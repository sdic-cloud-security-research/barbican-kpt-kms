"Barbican.  The most significant of these was the launch of the Let's Encrypt "
"public CA along with the definition of the ACME protocol for certificate "
"issuance.  We believe that future certificate authority services would do "
"good to implement the ACME standard, which is quite different than the API "

"within Barbican will simplify both the architecture and deployment of "
"Barbican.  This will allow us to focus on the features that Barbican does "
