    By default barbican checks only the algorithm and the bit_length when
    creating a new secret. The xts-mode cuts the key in half for aes, so for
    using aes-256 with xts, you have to use a 512 bit key, but barbican allows
    only a maximum of 256 bit. A check for the mode within the
    _is_algorithm_supported method of the class SimpleCryptoPlugin was added
    to allow 512 bit keys for aes-xts in this plugin.
