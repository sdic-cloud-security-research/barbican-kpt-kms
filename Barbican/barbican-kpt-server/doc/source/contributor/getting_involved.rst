Getting Involved
===================

The best way to join the community and get involved is to talk with others
online or at a meetup and offer contributions. Here are some of the many
ways you can contribute to the Barbican project\:

* Development and Code Reviews
* Bug reporting/Bug fixes
* Wiki and Documentation
* Blueprints/Specifications
* Testing
* Deployment scripts


Freenode IRC (Chat)
--------------------
You can find Barbicaneers in our publicly accessible channel on `freenode`_
``#openstack-barbican``. All conversations are logged and stored for your
convenience at `eavesdrop.openstack.org`_. For more information regarding
OpenStack IRC channels please visit the `OpenStack IRC Wiki`_.

.. _`freenode`: https://freenode.net
.. _`eavesdrop.openstack.org`: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/
                              %23openstack-barbican/

Mailing List
--------------
The mailing list email is openstack@lists.openstack.org. This is a common
mailing list across the OpenStack projects. If you wish to ask questions
or have a discussion related to Barbican include ``[barbican]`` in your
email subject line. To participate on the mailing list\:

* `Subscribe`_ to the mailing list
* Browse the `mailing list archives`_

.. _`Subscribe`: http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack
.. _`mailing list archives`: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack


Launchpad
-----------

Most of the tools used for OpenStack require a `launchpad.net`_ ID for
authentication.

.. _`launchpad.net`: https://launchpad.net


Storyboard
------------

The barbican project moved from Launchpad to `StoryBoard
<https://storyboard.openstack.org/>`_ for work and task tracking.
This provides an aggregate view called a "Project Group"
and individual "Projects". A good starting place is the
`project group <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project_group/81>`_
representing the whole of the barbican community, as opposed to
the `barbican project <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/980>`_
storyboard which represents barbican as a repository.


Source Repository
-------------------
Like other OpenStack related projects, the official Git repository is
available on `git.openstack.org`_; however, the repository is also mirrored
to GitHub for easier browsing.

* `Barbican on GitHub`_

.. _`Barbican on GitHub`: https://github.com/openstack/barbican


Gerrit
--------
Like other OpenStack related projects, we utilize the OpenStack Gerrit
review system for all code reviews. If you're unfamiliar with using
the OpenStack Gerrit review system, please review the `Gerrit Workflow`_
wiki documentation.
